# Matrix Operations-Diagonal Matrix Elements Printer üßÆ

This Python program reads a matrix of any size from the user and prints **only the diagonal elements**, leaving other elements blank in the output.

## üìå Aim

To write a Python program that prints only the diagonal elements of a given matrix.

## üß† Algorithm

1. Read the number of rows and columns from the user.
2. Initialize an empty matrix of size `rows √ó columns`.
3. Populate the matrix with user input.
4. Display the full matrix.
5. Iterate through the matrix and:
   - If `i == j`, print the element (main diagonal).
   - Else, print a blank space.
6. Print a newline after each row.

## üñ•Ô∏è Program
```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print("Diagonal elements:")
for i in range(len(matrix)):
    print(matrix[i][i])
```
### Output:
```
Input                                                REsult
[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]                      Diagonal elements:
                                                   1
                                                   5
                                                   9
```
## Result:
The program was successful.
